# Problem Set 1

Welcome to Problem Set 1! This problem set is designed to help you get familiar with the CS50 environment and basic programming concepts. Below are the steps you need to follow to complete this problem set.

### C. Source Code. Machine Code. Compiler. Correctness, Design, Style. Visual Studio Code. Syntax Highlighting. Escape Sequences. Header Files. Libraries. Manual Pages. Types. Conditionals. Variables. Loops. Linux. Graphical User Interface (GUI). Command-Line Interface (CLI). Constants. Comments. Pseudocode. Operators. Integer Overflow. Floating-Point Imprecision.

## Instructions:

1. **Access CS50 Environment:**
   - Log into `submit.cs50.io` using your GitHub account.
   - Click on "Authorize cs50" and then close the tab.
   - Log into `cs50.dev` using your GitHub account to access your personal "codespace."

2. **Prepare Your Codespace:**
   - Once your codespace has loaded, close any Welcome tabs that may have opened by default.
   - In your codespace's terminal window, run the command `update50` to ensure your codespace is up-to-date.
   - If prompted, click "Rebuild now" to ensure everything is set up correctly.

3. **Complete Hello, World:**
   - Implement the classic "Hello, World" program in C. This serves as a warm-up exercise to get you started with programming in C.

4. **Submit Hello, Itâ€™s Me:**
   - Submit your implementation of the "Hello, It's Me" program.

5. **Choose One of the Following:**
   - **Mario:**
     - Implement either the less comfortable or more comfortable version of the Mario pyramid-building program.
     - If you submit both versions, only the higher score will be recorded.

   - **Cash or Credit:**
     - Implement either the less comfortable Cash program or the more comfortable Credit program.
     - If you submit both, only the higher score will be recorded.

## Submission Guidelines:
- When submitting your solutions, ensure that your code adheres to the requirements specified in the problem set instructions.
- Submit your solutions on the CS50 IDE platform.
- In case of submitting multiple versions (e.g., both versions of Mario or both Cash and Credit), only the higher score will be recorded.

Remember to take your time, ask questions if you need help, and enjoy the learning process! Good luck with Problem Set 1!
